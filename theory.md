- **Node** - simple server
- **Pod**   
  -  abstraction over container 
  -  creates env on top of the container
  -  smallest unit of k8s
- **Service** and **Ingress**
  - each pod gets its own IP address ( they are able to communicate with each other using this internal IP not public )
  - when pod dies, new IP will resign to that pod
  - `Service` is the permanent IP and load balancer which means that service will actually catch the request and forward it to which pod list busy 
  - lifecycle of Pod and Service NOT connected
  - Ingress allow to use external service with (secures) domain name 
- **ConfigMap** and **Secret**
  - ConfigMap is the place where you can store your configuration data like database url
  - but you shouldn't put credentials into ConfigMap , you should store them in Secret
  - Secret is like ConfigMap but it used to store secret data
- **Volumes**
  - Volume component is used to store your db, it could be remote or local
  - cause when db pod dies, it's db would be gone , Volumes can help to avoid it (it is like external hard drive)
-  **Deployment** and **Stateful Set**
  - so when pod dies, there will be downtime where user can reach, so thats why we are replicating everything
  - we should specify how many replicas should run , define that blueprints and these are Deployment
  - you mostly work with Deployment rather than with nodes
  - if your pod dies, service will forward the request to another working replica to avoid downtime 
  - :warning: DB can't be replicated via Deployment
  - If we the clones replicas of db they would all need to  access the same shared data storage and there
  - you would need mechanism that would manage which pods are reading from that storage in order to avoid data inconsistency
